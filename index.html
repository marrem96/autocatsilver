		<h1 class="title">Technology</h1>
		<p>Autocatalytic silver is an alternative to conventional
			electroplating and immersion processes. The
			technology enables silver plating on high complex
			geometries with narrow tolerances, resulting in high
			quality performance. Hence, autocatalytic silver has
			the potential to both improve performance and reduce
			plating costs.

			The autocatalytic nature of the processes means that
			plating is continued as long as the substrate is in the
			plating bath, without applying a current. This differs
			from immersion processes, that only plates to a few
			tenths of a micron and from electroplating, that needs
			electrodes and an applied current, for plating.</p>

	<div class="application" id="application">
		<h1 class="title">Application</h1>
		<p>There are many applications foreseen, within
			space, telecom and electronics, for the	autocatalytic silver technology. For example:	Autocatalytic silver plating of 3D-printed
			aluminum microwave components. Autocatalytic silver plating of microwave filters and antennas. Plating of ASIG, (Autocatalytic Silver Immersion Gold), as final finish for PCB's. </p>

		<h2>ESM 100 (ASIG)</h2>
		<p>ESM 100 is an autocatalytic silver process used as a multi purpose final finish for Printed Circuit
			Boards, (PCB). <br><br>
			ESM 100, used in conjunction with immersion gold, in the ASIG-process, (Autocatalytic Silver
			Immersion Gold), gives excellent gold wire bonding and solder capability.<br><br>
			Further, ASIG was developed primarily as an alternative surface finish chip packaging substrates.
			<br><br>For PCB´s, ASIG has been developed as a replacement for nickel based surface finishes which are
			known to suffer from quality issues, such as brittle intermetallics or black pad failures.<br><br>

			Additional, evaluation performed for ESA,(European Space Agency), showed that the ASIG finish
			provided surfaces with good solderability even after having been exposed to two soldering
			processes. Solder joints formed to various types of components had good reliability. <p>

		<h2>ESM 200</h2>
		<p>ESM 200 is an autocatalytic silver process, designed to replace electrolytical silver and to give a
			conformal coating of silver with excellent electrical conductivity.<br><br>
			The ESM 200 process has been evaluated for ESA, in order to offer a solution to plate complex
			geometries for microwave components, in space applications. Autocatalytic silver plating of
			microwave components makes it possible to plate high complex geometries with narrow tolerances,
			highly required for space industry.<br><br>
			Further, aluminium components plated with electroless nickel + 5 micron silver with ESM 200,
			meets both RF- and space environment requirements.<br><br>
			Components, made of machined aluminium as well as 3D-printed aluminium, were plated with
			electroless nickel + ESM 200 and successfully evaluated as well.<br><br>
			Further, ESM 200 can be applied onto different surfaces such as, gold, copper, copper alloys and nickel.<p>
